This is the Ah3 Invoicing and Inventory System for Repair Shops Software
package. Please see docs/userman.pdf for information on building and
instalation as well as usage.

It requires GCC, Postgresql and the Qt library from www.trolltech.com. If
you are using the prebuilt version all you need is a Postgresql database
server which you can connect to. You can download Postgresql for free from
www.postgresql.org. It is always best to get the latest stable version
available.

If you have any questions or find a bug, let me know at joe@croftj.net. Of
course, being opensource any and all contributions are appreciated.

 Thanks for checking it out!
      Joe
